# htn_testing

Cardano Haskell Testnet testing with Docker (using the latest Ubuntu LTS (20.04 as of this date))

This setup was inspired by Mark Stopka's https://github.com/2nd-Layer/docker-hub-cardano-images/ with the addition of docker-compose and a few other things.

Will improve over time and possibly make it so that it will be deployable to Digital Ocean (or any cloud provider), possibly with K8s.
